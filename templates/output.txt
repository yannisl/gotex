Executive Summary {#executive-summary .unnumbered}
=================

This is a weekly executive report, outlining the MEP works at Doha
Oasis. It is circulated both internally and externally in view to inform
everyone of current progress, impediments and to reduce risks by
disseminating issues early enough.

Currently our focus is to boost production on Site, while closing any
outstanding designs and materials.

ELVs {#elvs .unnumbered}
----

Conspel has received the Technical Note from Arup, detailing the
requirements for all ELV systems and how they should be integrated with
the Smart City concept. We are now studying the document and it is our
intention to issue a high level preliminary planning document, of our
approach to implement teh requirements.

Design Developemnt {#design-developemnt .unnumbered}
------------------

The following have now been closed and issued to AECOM for their
approval in the form of confirmatory RFIs.

1.  Gravity Drainage.

2.  Theme Park Electrical Separation and Additional Power Requirements.

Materials
=========

During week ending 28th July, minor materials have been submitted and
approved, including Air-vents, tank accessories and the like.

Remaining Long Lead items are: Fans and LV Panels, which are expected to
close by the end of next week.

Conspel continues with ordering of materials, as fast as possible.

Systems
-------

The following material submittals have been issued for approval:

1.  Fuel System

2.  Gas System

Upon approval, the Gas Systems subcontractor is expected to start with
the design works.

Subcontractors
--------------

The Commissioning Management subcontractor has now been approved (AJB).

Material Deliveries
-------------------

Material deliveries to site continue. Current problematic deliveries are
deliveries for cable trays and accessories. Remedial measures have been
taken to submit a local supplier with better delivery schedules. These
are expected to start within 20 days, giving time for approvals,
ordering and issuing of any financial documents.

Fire Fighting materials are now in place, with piping, supports,
couplings all start arriving. We expect good progress of the Fire
Fighting works thereafter.

Construction
============

Mobilization
------------

Construction mobilization continues, with a total of 750 personnel on
Site. We expect another 200 tradesmen with the next 15 days, as more
materials and areas open up.

Basement Works
--------------

Large areas of B4, B3 have now been handed over to Conspel. We have
started works for drainage, fire-fighting and electrical second fix
installations. Mock-ups for riser installations are in progress and once
approved we expect to add personnel to accelerate the works.

Progress is still in small percentages, as it is reported by value.

Subcontractors
--------------

You can’t parse \[X\]HTML with regex. Because HTML can’t be parsed by
regex. Regex is not a tool that can be used to correctly parse HTML. As
I have answered in HTML-and-regex questions here so many times before,
the use of regex will not allow you to consume HTML. Regular expressions
are a tool that is insufficiently sophisticated to understand the
constructs employed by HTML. HTML is not a regular language and hence
cannot be parsed by regular expressions. Regex queries are not equipped
to break down HTML into its meaningful parts. so many times but it is
not getting to me. Even enhanced irregular regular expressions as used
by Perl are not up to the task of parsing HTML. You will never make me
crack. HTML is a language of sufficient complexity that it cannot be
parsed by regular expressions. Even Jon Skeet cannot parse HTML using
regular expressions. Every time you attempt to parse HTML with regular
expressions, the unholy child weeps the blood of virgins, and Russian
hackers pwn your webapp. Parsing HTML with regex summons tainted souls
into the realm of the living. HTML and regex go together like love,
marriage, and ritual infanticide. The &lt;center&gt; cannot hold it is
too late. The force of regex and HTML together in the same conceptual
space will destroy your mind like so much watery putty. If you parse
HTML with regex you are giving in to Them and their blasphemous ways
which doom us all to inhuman toil for the One whose Name cannot be
expressed in the Basic Multilingual Plane, he comes. HTML-plus-regexp
will liquify the n​erves of the sentient whilst you observe, your psyche
withering in the onslaught of horror. Rege̿̔̉x-based HTML parsers are the

The argument was that one could not use Regular Expressions to parse
HTML. In reality parsing wild HTML is very difficult as browsers aim to
render text even if there is malformed HTML, with many healing
algorithms employed. When Knuth designed TeX, the parsing was all
handcrafted. He did not automate any parts of it.
