\section{Material Deliveries}

Material deliveries to site continue. Current problematic deliveries are deliveries for cable trays and accessories. Remedial measures have been
taken to submit a local supplier with better delivery schedules. These are expected to start within 20 days, giving time for approvals, ordering
and issuing of any financial documents.

Fire Fighting materials are now in place, with piping, supports, couplings all start arriving. We expect good progress of the Fire Fighting works
thereafter.
