\section{Fonts}

Some of teh examples and packages we are using here, use fonts that are not normally found in a TeX distribution. A list is provided here.

\section{Preprocessor}

There are a number of preprocessors and batch files. The main one is gophd

gophd --install  --directory --options  Will install all the stuff from github (except fonts)

\section{Compilers}

Due to the usage of UTF8 phd works better with LuaLaTeX  and for simpler documents with LaTeX and XeLaTeX. However
if you use the latter engines, many of the scripts cannot be used.

\section{Lowering the Barriers}

Wordpress according to many Computer experts is badly coded etc..., however it has succeeded where non one would expect. The main reason it has
lowered the barriers for using it.

I am hoping to achieve the same with phd, where people can produce good books...
