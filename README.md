# gotex

This package provides supporting routines for rendering LaTeX using Go.

## Why

Although TeX can be programmed to achieve almost everything, it is difficult to use and has an unusual syntax; __gotex__ aims to bridge the gap where more complex calculations and operations can be made using Go and then any required rendering can be produced using TeX/LaTeX.
