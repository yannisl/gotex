# gotex

This package provides supporting routines for rendering LaTeX using Go.

##Why

Although TeX can be coerced to achieve almost everything, it is difficult to use and has an unusual syntax; __gotex__ aims to bridge the gap where more comlex calculations and operations can be done using Go and the rendering can be achieved using TeX/LaTeX.
